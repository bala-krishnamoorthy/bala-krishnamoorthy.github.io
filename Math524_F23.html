		  <p>
		    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology">Algebraic
		       topology</a> uses techniques from abstract
		       algebra to study how (topological) spaces
		       are <i>connected</i>. Most often, the algebraic
		       structures used
		       are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29">groups</a>
		       (but more elaborate structures such as rings or
		       modules also arise). A typical approach
		       projects continuous maps between topological
		       spaces onto homomorphisms between the
		       corresponding groups. This course will
		       introduce basic concepts of algebraic topology
		       at the first-year graduate level.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    We will follow mostly the
		      book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429493911">Elements
		      of Algebraic Topology by James R.~Munkres</a>,
		      and cover in a fair bit of detail the topics on
		      homology of simplicial complexes, relative
		      homology, cohomology, and the basics of duality
		      in manifolds (selected Sections from Chapters
		      1&ndash;5 and 8).  Another popular book
		      is <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">Algebraic
		      Topology by Allen Hatcher</a> which could be
		      used as a reference.  We will not have the time
		      to cover topics related to the fundamental
		      group.  We will stress geometric motivations as
		      well as applications (where relevant) throughout
		      the course.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    <b>Prerequisites:</b> Some background in general topology as
		    well as abstract algebra, both at the undergraduate level,
		    will be assumed. In particular, familiarity with the
		    concepts of continuous functions, connectedness, and
		    compactness, as well as with the concepts of groups,
		    homomorphisms, fields, and vector spaces will be helpful to
		    follow the course. But no particularly deep theorems from
		    these topics will be needed. Some flexibility could be
		    afforded as far as this background is concerned&mdash;please
		    contact the instructor if you have doubts.
