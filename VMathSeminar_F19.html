	      Scheduling of ticket inspectors in Deutsche Bahn inter-city express trains
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    In many transit systems including the Duetsche Bahn Railway in Europe,  passengers are legally required to purchase a ticket before riding the train, but are not physically forced to do so. Instead, train inspectors are deployed throughout the transit system to inspect passengers, and fine people who are riding the train illegally. With approximately 7 million people taking the train every day, it is crucial that  inspectors are deployed in a manner that will maximize the number of passengers that are controlled.

		  <p>
		    This summer I had the opportunity to travel to Germany for the GRIPS program offered through IPAM, in order to try and model/solve this problem for the Deutsche Bahn Railway System. In this talk, I will discuss how my team and I approached the problem, and some of the preliminary results we obtained. I will also discuss my experiences with the <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/graduate-level-research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-grips-berlin-2019/">IPAM GRIPS program</a>, in case anyone is interested in participating in it next summer.

	      Robust feasibility of nonlinear systems using degree theory
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		     We consider new approaches to characterize the robustness of solutions to a system of nonlinear equations. This problem arises in many applications such as the power grid and other infrastructure networks. We use techniques from algebraic topology (topological degree theory) to characterize the robustness margin of such systems of equations. We then cast the problem of checking for the specified conditions as a nonlinear optimization problem. Based on this formulation, we develop efficient computational techniques to estimate lower and upper bounds for the robustness margin.

	      Matching Methods for Observational Data with Small Group Sizes and Missing Covariates
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    In order to derive unbiased inference from observational data, matching methods are often applied to produce balanced treatment groups in terms of relevant background variables. Although many matching algorithms exit in the literature, most require a large control reservoir and can not deal with missing data. Random forest, averaging outcomes from many decision trees, is non-parametric in nature, can deal with missing data in the tree building process, and can produce more accurate and less model dependent estimates of propensity scores as well as a proximity matrix. In this study, iterative matching algorithms are developed in order to form balanced samples based on limited sample sizes for both groups. A R package implementing the proposed methods has also been developed. The proposed methods are applied to two data sets, arising from studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and student success.

	      Pathway Mining from Large Interaction Networks
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Biological signaling pathways describe a series of
		    molecular reactions that are initiated by an
		    external signal and culminate in a specific
		    cellular response (for example, a cell may grow,
		    divide, move, or die).  The wealth of
		    publicly-available data containing signaling
		    reactions provide an opportunity for automatically
		    reconstructing such pathways using computational
		    approaches. In this talk, I will describe
		    network-based methods that automatically
		    reconstruct signaling pathways from
		    protein-protein interaction data.  Our methods
		    successfully reconstruct human signaling pathways
		    with much higher precision and recall than several
		    state-of-the-art graph algorithms. Further, our
		    methods suggest experimentally testable hypotheses
		    about canonical signaling.  Extensions of this
		    work have constrained pathway reconstructions by
		    considering the spatial localization of
		    interactions within the cell, and I will also
		    describe our first steps in using ideas from
		    pathway reconstruction to discover signaling
		    pathways that are altered in cancer.

	      Complementary effects of adaptation and gain control on
	      sound encoding in primary auditory cortex
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    A common framework for describing the function of
		    auditory cortical neurons is the linear-nonlinear
		    spectro-temporal receptive field (LN STRF). This
		    model casts the time-varying neural spike rate as
		    a linear weighted sum of the immediately preceding
		    sound spectrogram, followed by nonlinear
		    rectification. Two models have expanded on the LN
		    STRF to account for sensory contextual effects,
		    using short-term plasticity (STP) or
		    contrast-dependent gain control (GC). Both improve
		    performance over the LN model, but they have never
		    been compared directly. Thus, it is unclear
		    whether they account for distinct processes or
		    describe the same phenomenon in different ways. To
		    address this question, we recorded the activity of
		    single primary auditory cortical neurons (n = 423)
		    in awake ferrets (n = 7) during presentation of
		    natural sound stimuli. We fit STRFs incorporating
		    one nonlinear mechanism (GC or STP) or both
		    mechanisms (GC+STP) on this single dataset. We
		    compared model performance using the correlation
		    coefficient (Pearson's R) between predicted and
		    observed time-varying spike rate for each
		    neuron. Our results indicate that the STP model
		    performs significantly better than the GC model,
		    and that the GC+STP model performs significantly
		    better than either individual model. This finding
		    indicates that the STP and GC models explain
		    distinct aspects of neural activity. Further, the
		    success of the combined model suggests that
		    auditory cortical neurons utilize at least two
		    independent mechanisms to adapt encoding
		    properties to different sensory contexts. Future
		    neuromorphic sound processing technologies may
		    therefore improve their performance by
		    incorporating both STP- and GC-based computations.

		  <p>
		    In chemical systems, water and organic liquids are

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    For survey stats practitioners, it sometimes feels
		    like the sky is falling.  Response rates are

		    be an effective tool to combine these different
		    data sources and to produce more efficient
		    estimators.  Drawing on my collaborations with the

	      Deductive program synthesis: computing fast code
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		     A persistent challenge in applied mathematics is
		     balancing expressiveness in programs with
		     computational performance. In an ideal world, we
		     would express a program in the language of our
		     mathematical domain and let the computer compute
		     a performant program that implements it.
		     Unfortunately, we often are forced to give up one
		     of these: choose expressivity at the cost of
		     performance, or performance at the cost of
		     expressivity.  It doesn't have to be this way.
		     Deductive synthesis is a mechanism by which
		     programs can be deduced from specifications
		     through a refinement process.  This talk will
		     introduce the synthesis concept and discuss the
		     technical challenges that have prevented it from
		     being adopted in widespread use today.  I will
		     also introduce a testbed under development to
		     make deductive synthesis accessible to users
		     outside specific corners of computer science and
