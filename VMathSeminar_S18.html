	      Why Should We Care About Category Theory?
	      <div data-role="" class="">

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    One of the first mathematical concepts we learn as
		    children is counting, and when we do so, we think
		    of counting the number of elements in a specific
		    set. Soon after, we forget about sets and we just
		    consider the abstract numbers themselves. This
		    abstraction simplifies many things, but it also
		    makes us forget about some structure that we had
		    when we were thinking about sets. That structure
		    can be encoded by a category. In this talk we will
		    describe certain concepts in category theory, and
		    you will realize that in most of your mathematics
		    classes you have been working with categories, you
		    just didn't know about it. There will be plenty of
		    examples that will show that category theory
		    provides a unifying language for mathematics, and
		    that many constructions are more naturally
		    understood when they are seen through the
		    categorical lens.

	      Modeling of Perceptual Invariances in Biological Sensory

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    A problem faced by all perceptual systems is
		    natural variability in sensory stimuli associated
		    with the same object. This is a common problem in
		    sensory perception: Interpreting varied optical
		    signals as originating from the same object
		    requires a large degree of tolerance
		    <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/39/12978.short">[1]</a>. Understanding
		    speech requires identifying phonemes, such as the
		    consonant /g/, that constitute spoken words. A /g/
		    is perceived as a /g/, despite tremendous
		    variability in acoustic structure that depends on
		    the surrounding vowels and
		    consonants <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142028?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&">[2]</a>. A
		    major goal of an object recognition problem then
		    is the ability to identify individual objects
		    while being invariant to changes stemming from
		    multiple stimulus transformations.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    In an ongoing project <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12868-017-0371-2">[3]</a>,
		    we are testing the hypothesis that broad
		    perceptual invariance is achieved through specific
		    combinations of what we term locally invariant
		    elements. The main questions we would like to
		    address are: 1. What are the characteristics of
		    locally-invariant units in sensory pathways?
		    2. How are biological locally-invariant units
		    combined to achieve broadly invariant percepts?
		    3. What are the appropriate mathematical
		    structures with which to address and model these
		    sensory processes?  The mathematical aspects of
		    the research involve an interesting combination of
		    probability theory (a must in the study of
		    biological sensory systems) and group theory,
		    needed to characterize invariants and symmetries.

	      The Parameterization of PPA Formulas Using a SORTIE-ND
	      Model for Harvard Forest
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Spatially-implicit forest growth models, such as
		    the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA), allow
		    for the computationally efficient scaling of
		    forest dynamics to the landscape scale, by using
		    simplified mechanisms of individual tree
		    competition. The parameterization and calibration
		    of PPA using empirical data is challenging,
		    limiting its applications in biogeochemistry and
		    forest modeling. In contrast, the statistical
		    methodology for parameterization of spatially
		    explicit individual-based forest models, such as
		    SORTIE, is well developed. In this work we
		    parameterize the spatially-implicit PPA model by
		    calibrating the spatially-explicit SORTIE-ND model
		    using Harvard forest as a test site. Despite the
		    two models using different tree competition
		    mechanisms, both predicted similar biomass
		    dynamics. Community composition diverged in the
		    two models: between an Eastern hemlock dominated
		    system in SORTIE-ND and a red maple dominated in
		    PPA. This illustrates that the different
		    competition mechanisms employed in
		    spatially-explicit and -implicit models can lead
		    to different predictions of forest successions,
		    and provides a method for an initial
		    parametrization of PPA using SORTIE-ND which is
		    sufficient for scaling of biomass dynamics, but
		    requires further calibration for species dynamics.

	      The Curse of Dimensionality and Image Recognition
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Despite the high test-accuracy of state of the art
		    image recognition models, optimization methods can
		    be used to find "worst-case" images that are
		    similar to test images from a human perspective,
		    but for which the model fails its image
		    recognition task. Though high test-accuracy would
		    indicate that these images are rare, this
		    phenomenon can be used by an adversary who will
		    benefit from model failure and can alter either
		    the physical space or image stream to match the
		    worst-case image. For this reason, these
		    worst-case images are known in the literature as
		    "adversarial examples". I will give an overview of
		    this space, and present recent results from
		    another group that further highlight the
		    connection between the existence of adversarial
		    examples and the large dimensionality of the model
		    input.

	      Forest Canopy Stability in the Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA) Model
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    The Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA) is
		    system of equations that predicts the large-scale
		    dynamics of forest stands. The model is
		    computationally efficient and is employed to
		    scaling of vegetation dynamics and carbon and
		    nutrient cycles using parameter values and
		    functional forms of individual tree species. The
		    model includes the system of McKendrick–von
		    Foerster partial differential equations (one for
		    every tree species) and an integral equation (the
		    PPA equation). The McKendrick–von Foerster
		    equation is a conservation law-based first-order
		    hyperbolic partial-differential equation similar
		    to the advection or transport equations that can
		    be solved using the method of characteristics;
		    however, the non-linear PPA integral equation
		    presents a substantial challenge. In this
		    presentation we will discuss structural stability
		    of the PPA model, including the observed tendency
		    of trees with particular shapes to produce
		    unstable canopies. We will introduce analytic
		    conditions of canopy stability an arbitrary crown
		    shapes.

	      Toward the efficient approximation of energetic and

	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Over the past 80 years, forest models have
		    progressed from empirical linear models to
		    physiological process models to hybrids of
		    both. Early empirical models simulated the growth
		    and yield of pure even-aged forest stands. Four
		    decades later, individual-based multi-species
		    physiological gap models emerged with JABOWA and
		    FORET. Despite reasonable fidelity to Moore's Law,
		    efforts to upscale gap models remain limited by
		    algorithmic and parametric complexity, with
		    existing solutions relying on sampling
		    strategies. Following model reduction techniques
		    demonstrated in LANDSIM, a new class of model
		    emerged blending empirical and physiological
		    components. Such hybrid models include the two
		    popular cohort models, LANDIS-II and
		    Sortie-PPA. While the former is based on species
		    life history strategies and the CENTURY model, the
		    latter is based on phototropism and crown
		    plasticity combined with recent biogeochemistry
		    models. Here, I discuss approximations used in
		    LANDIS-II and Sortie-PPA. I also discuss combining
		    the PPA cohort model with a big-leaf
		    biogeochemistry model in the latest version of
		    Sortie-PPA, known as Sortie-PPA-BGC, intended to
		    inform future terrestrial biosphere
		    models. Finally, I discuss the development of the
		    <i>forestmodels</i> Python library, designed to
		    provide a unified interface to forest
		    biogeochemistry models, including helper functions
		    for data acquisition, parameter estimation, and
		    model intercomparison. This is joint work with
		    Robert Scheller, Nikolay Strigul, and Melissa
		    Lucash.
