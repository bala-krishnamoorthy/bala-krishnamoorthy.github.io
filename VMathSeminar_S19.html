	      Improved inference and autotyping in EEG-based brain

	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    The RSVP Keyboard is a typing system for people
		    with severe physical disabilities, specifically
		    those with locked-in syndrome (LIS). It uses
		    signals from an electroencephalogram (EEG)
		    combined with information from an n-gram language
		    model to select letters to be typed. One
		    characteristic of the system as currently
		    configured is that it does not keep track of past
		    EEG observations, i.e., observations of user
		    intent made while the user was in a different part
		    of a typed message. We present a principled
		    approach for taking all past observations into
		    account, and show that this method results in a
		    20% increase in simulated typing speed under a
		    variety of conditions on realistic stimuli. We
		    also show that this method allows for a principled
		    and improved estimate of the probability of the
		    backspace symbol, by which mis-typed symbols are
		    corrected. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of
		    automatically typing likely letters in certain
		    contexts, a technique that achieves increased
		    typing speed under our new method, though not
		    under the baseline approach.

	      From Causal Inference to Gene Regulation
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		     A recent break-through in genomics makes it
		     possible to perform perturbation experiments at a
		     very large scale.  The availability of such data
		     motivates the development of a causal inference
		     framework that is based on observational and
		     interventional data. We first characterize the
		     causal relationships that are identifiable from
		     interventional data. In particular, we show that
		     imperfect interventions, which only modify (i.e.,
		     without necessarily eliminating) the dependencies
		     between targeted variables and their causes,
		     provide the same causal information as perfect
		     interventions, despite being less
		     invasive. Second, we present the first provably
		     consistent algorithm for learning a causal
		     network from a mix of observational and
		     interventional data. This requires us to develop
		     new results in geometric combinatorics. In
		     particular, we introduce DAG associahedra, a
		     family of polytopes that extend the prominent
		     graph associahedra to the directed setting. We
		     end by discussing applications of this causal
		     inference framework to the estimation of gene
		     regulatory networks.

	      Validation of a simple biogeochemistry variant of
	      SORTIE-PPA in two temperate forests using the Erde
	      modeling framework
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    While vegetation model development has accelerated
		    over the past three decades, less progress has
		    been made in software interfaces that bind models
		    and data. Such interfaces become necessary as
		    model complexity increases, making models more
		    cumbersome for new users to parameterize, run, and
		    analyze. Furthermore, model wrappers may provide
		    new modeling capabilities, such as Bayesian
		    optimization. Toward this end, we have developed a
		    simple geoscientific simulation model API and
		    toolkit in R and Python known as the Earth-systems
		    Research and Development Environment (Erde). While
		    Erde is primarily intended for vegetation models,
		    its data structures and algorithms are applicable
		    across a range of geoscientific modeling
		    domains.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    We demonstrate an application of Erde with a
		    simple biogeochemistry variant of SORTIE-PPA known
		    as PPA-SiBGC. The PPA-SiBGC model combines the
		    Perfect Plasticity Approximation with explicit
		    above-and-below-ground biogeochemical pools and
		    simple flux models. We parameterized, ran, and
		    validated PPA-SiBGC at two research forests in the
		    Eastern United States: (1) Harvard Forest,
		    Massachusetts (HF-EMS) and (2) Jones Ecological
		    Research Center, Georgia (JERC-RD). We assessed
		    model fitness using these temporal metrics: net
		    ecosystem exchange, aboveground net primary
		    production, aboveground biomass, C, and N,
		    belowground biomass, C, and N, soil respiration,
		    and, species total biomass and relative
		    abundance. Without applying any optimization, we
		    found that a simple biogeochemistry variant of
		    SORTIE-PPA was able to outperform an established
		    forest landscape model (LANDIS-II NECN) across the
		    metrics tested. While LANDIS-II NECN showed better
		    NEE fit, PPA-SiBGC demonstrated better overall
		    correspondence to field data for both sites
		    (HF-EMS: \(\overline{R^2} = 0.73, +0.07\),
		    \(\overline{RMSE} = 4.68, -9.96\); JERC-RD:
		    \(\overline{R^2} = 0.73, +0.01\),
		    \(\overline{RMSE} = 2.18, -1.64\))

	      The Future of Statistical Bioinformatics and Genomics in
	      the Automated World of Agriculture
	      
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    World population is expected to reach 9.6 billion
		    by 2050, and crop yields are not keeping pace fast
		    enough to avoid widespread food shortages. Modern
		    molecular breeding programs are extremely
		    effective, and can generate annual yield increases
		    of around 4%. However, it is not scalable due to
		    both the human labor and expertise
		    required. Employing robots in agriculture has
		    great potential to address chronic issues that are
		    challenging food systems in the developing
		    world. While quantitative trait locus (QTL)
		    mapping associates molecular with variation in
		    traits, there are new challenges for the
		    statistical bioinformatics and genomics
		    communities in how data are collected, stored and
		    analyzed with respect to understanding
		    relationships between genetic composition and
		    phenotype. Using automation, the expectation is a
		    dramatic increase, factor of 100+, in the number
		    of individuals in the breeding population that can
		    be evaluated. Artificial intelligence based
		    technologies and analysis allow rapid evaluation,
		    and thus make molecular breeding adaptive to
		    environmental and other changes. Automated
		    phenotyping is a transformational technology that
		    can be applied worldwide.

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Mapper is a powerful construction from topological
		    data analysis that is designed for the analysis
		    and visualization of multivariate data. We
		    investigate a method for stitching a pair of
		    mappers together, and study a topological notion
		    of information gain as well as a general measure
		    of correlation during such a process. We are
		    inspired by the ideas of stepwise regression for
		    model selection and of scatterplot matrices for
		    visualization, and introduce a topological
		    analogue of the scatterplot matrix for the mapper,
		    and study the degree of topological correlation
		    between filter functions.

	      <div data-role="" class="">

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Most technologists have some basic understanding
		    of quantum computing. Quantum bits are represented
		    by qubits, and information isn't simply a zero or
		    one, it can be both at the same time, representing
		    much more information. A quantum effect known as
		    entanglement linking two particles allows
		    instantaneous communication.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    Ultimately, quantum computing promises to be a
		    disruptive technology with such dramatic speed
		    improvements that real tractable solutions to hard
		    problems could be solved in hours and days. These
		    same problems would take hundreds of years to
		    solve on our best supercomputers, known as a
		    classical computer, by brute-forcing their way
		    searching through all possible solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    This presentation we will look at Quantum
		    Computing with an overview of Quantum Mechanics,
		    qubits and quantum logic, linear algebra and
		    quantum gates and transformations, quantum
		    algorithms such as Shor's Factoring and Grover's
		    search algorithms, and an evaluation of the level
		    of performance of current quantum computers and
		    software platforms.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		    We will discuss the recent rapid increase in
		    quantum company growth, new quantum hardware and
		    software offerings, and new government funding,
		    and the push to develop a quantum-literate
		    workforce.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    These recent activities suggest the Quantum
		    Information Science "tipping point" is now!

		  <p>
		    In this talk, we consider two types of data from
		    neuroscience: neuromorphology data and neuron
		    activity data. First, we focus on data extracted
		    from brain neuron cells of rodents and model each
		    neuron as a data object with topological and
		    geometric properties characterizing the branching
		    structure, connectedness and orientation of a
		    neuron. We define the notions of topological and
		    geometric medians as well as quantiles based on
		    newly-developed curve representations. In
		    addition, we take a novel approach to define the
		    Pareto medians and quantiles through a
		    multi-objective optimization problem. In
		    particular, we study two different objective
		    functions which measure the topological variation
		    and geometric variation respectively. Analytical
		    solutions are provided for topological and
		    geometric medians and quantiles, and in general,
		    for Pareto medians and quantiles, the genetic
		    algorithm is implemented. The proposed methods are
		    demonstrated in a simulation study and are also
		    applied to analyze a real data set of pyramidal
		    neurons from the hippocampus. Next, we model the
		    neuron spiking activity through nonlinear
		    dynamical systems. We adapt the Volterra series
		    expansion of an analytic function to account for
		    the point-process nature of multiple inputs and a
		    single output (MISO) in a neural ensemble. Our
		    model describes the transformed spiking
		    probability for the output as the sum of
		    kernel-weighted integrals of the inputs. The
		    kernel functions need to be identified and
		    estimated, and both local sparsity (kernel
		    functions may be zero on part of their support)
		    and global sparsity (some kernel functions may be
		    identically zero) are of interest. The kernel
		    functions are approximated by B-splines and a
		    penalized likelihood-based approach is proposed
		    for estimation. Even for moderately complex brain
		    functionality, the identification and estimation
		    of this sparse functional dynamical model poses
		    major computational challenges, which we address
		    with big data techniques that can be implemented
		    on a single, multi-core server. The performance of
		    the proposed method is demonstrated using neural
		    recordings from the hippocampus of a rat during
		    open field tasks. This is the joint work with
		    Dr. Sienkiewicz, Professor Breidt and Professor
		    Song.

	      Modeling mutualisms in plants and cancer
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Essentially every biological interaction has a
		    combination of positive and negative feedbacks,
		    but capturing that in models proves surprisingly
		    difficult. I will discuss two models of so-called
		    mutualisms. Using a resource-mediated interaction
		    of plants with their soil microbiome, we will look
		    at whether mutualisms buffer the system against
		    environmental perturbations. With the second, a
		    model of how cancer cells coopt the behavior of
		    promoters of cell growth, we will try to
		    understand why cancer is rare but possible.

	      Kal-Toh: The Vulcan Game of Triconnected Planar Graphs
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Star Trek: Voyager, a television program from the
		    late 90s, featured a game played by the
		    hyper-logical Vulcan race called Kal-Toh. Said by
		    characters to dwarf chess in complexity, the game,
		    which features the placement of a clump of metal
		    rods, can be well-represented by the framework we
		    know as graph theory. I will discuss a paper
		    written by Terry David Anderson from the
		    University of Waterloo in which, as a
		    representation of Kal-Toh, studies the problem of
		    determining the existence of a polyhedral subgraph
		    of some graph G. In the exploration of this
		    problem, Anderson finds that both showing the
		    existence of such a subgraph and obtaining an
		    optimal strategy, in a game of two players, for
		    achieving such a subgraph first are NP-hard
		    problems.

	      A Bayesian nonparametric multiple testing procedure for
	      comparing several treatments against a control
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    We propose a Bayesian nonparametric strategy to
		    test for differences between a control group and
		    several treatment regimes. Many of the existing
		    tests for this type of comparison are based on the
		    differences between location or scale
		    parameters. In contrast, our approach identifies
		    differences across the entire distributions,
		    avoids strong modeling assumptions over the
		    distributions for each treatment, and accounts for
		    multiple testing through the prior distribution on
		    the space of hypotheses. The proposal is compared
		    to other commonly used hypothesis testing
		    procedures under simulated scenarios.

	      Higher-order clustering of complex networks
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Spectral clustering is a well-known way to
		    partition a graph or network into clusters or
		    communities with provable guarantees on the
		    quality of the clusters. This guarantee is known
		    as the Cheeger inequality and it holds for
		    undirected graphs. We'll discuss a new
		    generalization of the Cheeger inequality to
		    higher-order structures in networks including
		    network motifs. This is easy to implement and
		    seamlessly generalizes spectral clustering to
		    directed, signed, and many other types of complex
		    networks. In particular, our generalization allow
		    us to re-use the large history of existing ideas
		    in spectral clustering including local methods,
		    overlapping methods, and relationships with kernel
		    k-means. We will illustrate the types of clusters
		    or communities found by our new method in
		    biological, neuroscience, ecological,
		    transportation, and social networks.
