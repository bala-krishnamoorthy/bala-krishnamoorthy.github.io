		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    No longer do machine learning algorithms run in
		    the background of our daily lives. Now, doctors
		    interact directly with models to aid in diagnoses,
		    autonomous cars drive around us with little
		    supervision, and judges incorporate model
		    predictions into sentencing. As the complexity of
		    machine learning models and artificial
		    intelligence escape us, we need new mechanisms for
		    understanding model decision making processes.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    We propose a new technique for instance based
		    explanation of predictions using Topological Data
		    Analysis. Our method develops an interactive
		    visualization of the learned model, which can be
		    probed by model users. By providing examples of
		    similar observations that influence a model
		    decisions, this technique requires no expert
		    knowledge of machine learning to interpret. We
		    will introduce machine learning, explanation
		    techniques, and Topological Data Analysis, and
		    present ongoing work of using TDA to provide
		    credence to model predictions.

	      Equidistribution of sequences on the <i>p</i>-adic unit ball
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Techniques from harmonic analysis play a crucial
		    role in understanding problems in analytic number
		    theory. For example, in 1916 Hermann Weyl
		    initiated the study of the equidistribution of
		    sequences on the additive circle, connecting
		    Fourier analysis to number theoretic dynamics.
		    Such techniques can be extended to other locally
		    compact abelian groups, leading to some
		    interesting number theory. We look at
		    the <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number"><i>p</i>-adic</a>
		    unit ball as one such example, and show how
		    Fourier analytic techniques can give us an
		    understanding of the distribution of sequences.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    This talk is primarily intended to give a general
		    mathematical audience a flavor and appreciation of
		    this type of mathematics, and only a basic
		    knowledge of analysis will be assumed.

		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    This talk will demonstrate two capabilities for
		    interactive and explainable machine learning. The
		    first capability, CHISSL, addresses machine
		    learning’s “elephant in the room”—that good models
		    require substantial human annotated data, which is
		    difficult or expensive to acquire. CHISSL allows
		    an analyst to flexibly explore and annotate large
		    unlabeled datasets. CHISSL is significantly more
		    responsive than existing machine learning
		    techniques, while still maintaining high
		    accuracy. Our second capability, "Escape Routes",
		    is a new approach to exploring high dimensional
		    data. The technique allows an analyst to see
		    plausible pathways linking together arbitrary data
		    points, which we believe is especially helpful to
		    understand a classification model’s behavior
		    across decision boundaries. Both capabilities are
		    generalizable to a multitude of different data
		    types including text, images, sequences, and time
		    series. For future work, we would like to work
		    with other interested researchers who want to try
		    these new capabilities on their challenging data
		    and applications.

	      Variational methods in image

	      	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Many inverse problems arising in image processing
		    can be solved by variational methods. A functional
		    is minimized, composed of a data fidelity term and
		    a regularizing term. The regularizing term imposes
		    a-priori constraints on the solution and makes the
		    problem well-posed. The unknown is found in the
		    appropriate space of functions that best
		    characterizes the desired properties of the
		    solution. The Euler-Lagrange equation associated
		    with the minimization is obtained and then solved
		    using numerical methods. In this talk I will
		    present several inverse problems arising in
		    imaging applications and their solutions in a
		    variational approach. Examples include image
		    restoration, segmentation, decomposition, and
		    medical applications such as image reconstruction
		    in computer tomography. Theoretical and
		    experimental results will be presented.

	      Robust Feasibility of Quadratic Systems
              <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    We consider the problem of measuring the margin of
		    robust feasibility of solutions to a system of
		    nonlinear equations. We study the special case of
		    a system of quadratic equations, which shows up in
		    many practical applications such as the power grid
		    and other infrastructure networks. We develop
		    approaches based on topological degree theory to
		    estimate bounds on the robustness margin of such
		    systems. Our methods use tools from convex
		    analysis and optimization theory to cast the
		    problems of checking the conditions for robust
		    feasibility as a nonlinear optimization
		    problem. We conclude with some preliminary
		    modeling results and a discussion about future
		    research directions.

	      Euler transformation of polyhedral meshes
              <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Geometric regions are typically represented using
		    polyhedral meshes (including triangulations) in
		    most applications. Efficient coverage of the
		    regions using edges in the mesh is of primary
		    interest in several domains including robotic
		    motion planning and 3D printing. For instance, a
		    robot monitoring or serving the region might want
		    to move "efficiently" along the edges in the mesh
		    so as to cover the entire region without doing any
		    backtracking. In a standard format for 3D printing
		    (termed "sparse infill"), the extruder prints only
		    the edges of the mesh, creating a "skeleton". An
		    ideal print path would start at a point, print
		    every edge exactly once, and return to the
		    start. Such a tour is called an Eulerian tour.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    In what is considered the first theorem in graph
		    theory (presented in 1736), Euler described the
		    condition that guarantees when a graph has such a
		    tour - hence the name. But meshes generated using
		    standard approaches are not guaranteed to contain
		    an Eulerian tour of its edges. We present a method
		    to transform any polyhedral mesh into one that is
		    guaranteed to contain an Eulerian tour. We will
		    highlight properties of this transformation using
		    several pictures, including one illustrating its
		    use in 3D printing (as implemented by
		    collaborators in ORNL).

	      Central place foragers and moving stimuli: A
	      hidden-state model to discriminate the processes
	      affecting movement
              <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Human activities can influence the movement of
		    organisms, either repelling or attracting
		    individuals depending on whether they interfere
		    with natural behavioral patterns or enhance access
		    to food. To discern the processes affecting such
		    interactions, an appropriate analytical approach
		    must reflect the motivations driving behavioral
		    decisions at multiple scales. In this study, we
		    developed a modelling framework for the analysis
		    of foraging trips by central place foragers. By
		    recognizing the distinction between movement
		    phases at a larger scale and movement steps at a
		    finer scale, our model can identify periods when
		    animals are actively following moving attractors
		    in their landscape. We applied the framework to
		    GPS tracking data of northern fulmars Fulmarus
		    glacialis, paired with contemporaneous fishing
		    boat locations, to quantify the putative
		    scavenging activity of these seabirds on discarded
		    fish and offal. We estimated the rate and scale of
		    interaction between individual birds and fishing
		    boats and the interplay with other aspects of a
		    foraging trip. Our approach can be used to
		    characterize interactions between central place
		    foragers and different anthropogenic or natural
		    stimuli and can be adapted to explore the movement
		    of other species that are subject to multiple
		    dynamic drivers.

	      Applications of topology for information fusion
              <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    In the era of "big data" we are often overloaded
		    with information from a variety of
		    sources. Information fusion is important when
		    different data sources provide information about
		    the same phenomena. For example, news articles and
		    social media feeds may both be providing
		    information about current events. In order to
		    discover a consistent world view, or a set of
		    competing world views, we must understand how to
		    aggregate, or "fuse", information from these
		    different sources. In practice much of information
		    fusion is done on an ad hoc basis, when given two
		    or more specific data sources to fuse. For
		    example, fusing two video feeds which have
		    overlapping fields of view may involve coordinate
		    transforms; merging GPS data with textual data may
		    involve natural language processing to find
		    locations in the text data and then projecting
		    both sources onto a map visualization. But how
		    does one do this in general? It turns out that the
		    mathematics of sheaf theory, a domain within
		    algebraic topology, provides a canonical and
		    provably necessary language and methodology for
		    general information fusion. In this talk I will
		    motivate the introduction of sheaf theory through
		    the lens of information fusion examples.

	       Spectral sparsification of simplicial complexes for clustering and label propagation

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    As a generalization of the use of graphs to
		    describe pairwise interactions, simplicial
		    complexes can be used to model higher-order
		    interactions between three or more objects in
		    complex systems. There has been a recent surge in
		    activity for the development of data analysis
		    methods applicable to simplicial complexes,
		    including techniques based on computational
		    topology, higher-order random processes,
		    generalized Cheeger inequalities, isoperimetric
		    inequalities, and spectral methods. In particular,
		    spectral learning methods (e.g. label propagation
		    and clustering) that directly operate on
		    simplicial complexes represent a new direction for
		    analyzing such complex datasets.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    To apply spectral learning methods to massive
		    datasets modeled as simplicial complexes, we
		    develop a method for sparsifying simplicial
		    complexes that preserves the spectrum of the
		    associated Laplacian matrices. We show that the
		    theory of Spielman and Srivastava for the
		    sparsification of graphs extends to simplicial
		    complexes via the up Laplacian. In particular, we
		    introduce a generalized effective resistance for
		    simplices, provide an algorithm for sparsifying
		    simplicial complexes at a fixed dimension, and
		    give a specific version of the generalized Cheeger
		    inequality for weighted simplicial
		    complexes. Finally, we introduce higher-order
		    generalizations of spectral clustering and label
		    propagation for simplicial complexes and
		    demonstrate via experiments the utility of the
		    proposed spectral sparsification method for these
		    applications.
