		  <p>
		    Solving optimization problems with variables
		    restricted to take integer values, as opposed to
		    real values, is called <a target="_blank"
		    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">integer
		    optimization</a>. The subject, also commonly
		    called integer programming (IP), uses concepts
		    form various areas of mathematics and computer
		    science including linear algebra, combinatorics,
		    geometry of numbers, algebraic geometry, as well
		    as algorithms and data structures. IP techniques
		    have been used to model and solve problems in
		    electrical power systems, airline crew scheduling,
		    economic lot-sizing, transportation and logistics,
		    treatment of tumors using radiation, computational
		    biology, and many other areas.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This graduate level course aims to provide a
		    detailed treatment of the theory, solution
		    methods, and applications of integer and
		    combinatorial optimization. Topics covered could
		    include IP formulations, binary expressions and
		    conjunctive normal form (CNF), enumerative methods
		    (branch-and-bound), theory of cutting planes,
		    lattice-based approaches including basis
		    reduction, polyhedral geometry, and computational
		    complexity. We will also emphasize the use of
		    state-of-the-art software packages to model and
		    solve real-life problems. The
		    packages <a target="_blank"
		    href="http://www.ampl.com">AMPL</a>
		    and <a target="_blank"
		    href="http://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a> will be
		    introduced through several homework problems and
		    project(s).
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    As a prerequisite, students should have taken an
		    undergraduate level course in Linear Optimization
		    (<a target="_blank"
		    href="https://archive.math.www.wsu.edu/faculty/bkrishna/Math364.html">MATH
		    364</a>, <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://archive.math.www.wsu.edu/faculty/bkrishna/Math464.html">MATH
		    464</a> which is preferred, or equivalent), or
		    obtain the permission of the
		    instructor. Exceptions could be made on a
		    case-by-case basis for this
		    requirement. Familiarity with programming
		    language(s), or packages such as Matlab or Python
		    will be helpful, but not required.
