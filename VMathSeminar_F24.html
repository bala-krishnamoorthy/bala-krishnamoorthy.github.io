	      Conditional Periodicity of Time Series Via Persistent Homology
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Given a pair of time series over the same time
		    period, we are interested in studying how the
		    periodicity of one influences the periodicity of
		    the other. For instance, consider the average
		    amount of rainfall per day and the average number
		    of umbrellas used per day over time. One would
		    expect these series to occur at similar
		    frequencies, while on the other hand, we'd expect
		    the frequencies of average amount of rainfall and
		    average number of cookies eaten over time to be
		    less similar. There are several known methods to
		    measure the similarity between a pair of time
		    series. While many experimental results show
		    robustness of these similarity measures, we have
		    yet to find any measures with known theoretical
		    stability results.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    Persistence homology from the field of topological
		    data analysis has been utilized to construct a
		    scoring function with theoretical proofs of
		    stability that quantifies the periodicity of a
		    single univariate time series. Building on this
		    concept, we propose a conditional periodicity
		    score that quantifies the periodicity of one
		    univariate time series given another. We introduce
		    several mathematical statements we aim to prove
		    that demonstrate theoretical stability of our
		    conditional scoring function, as well as a
		    pseudocode for computing our conditional
		    periodicity score on pairs of discrete time
		    series. We end with some preliminary findings.

	      Fair and efficient sharing: Dynamic pricing control for
	      shuttle bus system with strategic customers
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Motivated by the application of shuttle bus
		    systems such as those at airports, and
		    ride-sharing services like Uber, we propose a
		    dynamic pricing control model by applying a
		    strategic joining/balking scheme in which the fees
		    for each customer and time of service commencement
		    depend on their experienced waiting time cost in
		    batch service (shuttle) systems.  In this model,
		    the monopolist sets the fee for each customer so
		    that all customers on the same shuttle have equal
		    utility (including waiting costs). If the total
		    time cost for waiting customers exceeds a certain
		    threshold, the monopolist allows the shuttle to
		    depart, even if the number of customers is less
		    than the full capacity (i.e., early departure) of
		    the shuttle, enabling the fair determination of
		    fees.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    This study aims to verify the superiority of the
		    dynamic pricing control model. We present a unique
		    Nash equilibrium strategy, an algorithm for the
		    transition probability, and effective
		    approximations for the expected inter-arrival
		    times of customers, conditional on the occurrence
		    of early departure under the restriction that
		    early departure can be executed only immediately
		    before the arrival of the next customer. Then, we
		    derive several performance measures to evaluate
		    the dynamic pricing control model. Through
		    numerical experiments, we confirm that our
		    analytical results closely align with those of the
		    general model, in which the timing of early
		    departure is not restricted&mdash;implying the
		    usefulness of our theoretical analysis. Moreover,
		    we demonstrate that the dynamic pricing control
		    model is superior to the conventional fixed
		    pricing control model in terms of fairness to
		    customers and performance efficiency. The proposed
		    model benefits customers, society, and the
		    monopolist in the long run, as it enhances the
		    overall quality of services and customer
		    satisfaction, reduces waiting costs, and improves
		    revenue.

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    This presentation dives into the world of minimal
		    homotopy in the plane, tracing its history and
		    significance in math. We kick things off by
		    defining homotopy and minimal homotopy, and why
		    continuous paths and deformations are key to
		    deeper understanding. We'll look at major
		    breakthroughs, including Douglas and Radó's work
		    on the Plateau problem, to show how minimal

		    explore recent advancements, including new
		    algorithms for computing minimal homotopy areas,
		    and extend the conversation to higher dimensions,
		    discussing the challenges and potential extensions
		    of minimal homotopy. To wrap it up, we'll outline
		    future research directions and open questions,
		    emphasizing the ongoing relevance and potential
		    applications of minimal homotopy in both
		    theoretical and applied math. This overview aims
		    to give researchers and enthusiasts alike a deeper

		  <p>
		    This presentation examines the stability and

		    (NFSOMs), which integrate neural field theory with
		    the dynamic SOM algorithm. Using Lyapunov's

		    results are applied to a computational model,
		    providing testable stability criteria and insights

	      Estimating the Carbon Cost of Large Inventory Organizations

		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    For both voluntary action and regulatory
		    compliance, large organizations need detailed
		    information about their direct emissions (from
		    their facilities and properties) and indirect
		    emissions (attributable to their activities but
		    occurring outside their facilities). However,
		    estimating indirect emissions is costly and
		    complex, often involving the environmental
		    footprint of thousands of products and services
		    within global supply chains. In response, we
		    develop a heuristic approach to estimating Scope 3
		    emissions that combines life cycle assessment and
		    data analytics. This approach leverages
		    product-level information (unit cost, quantity
		    consumed, and average lifecycle emissions of
		    materials) to derive scientifically grounded
		    estimates of aggregate and distributed
		    emissions. We apply this approach to the
		    healthcare sector, revealing different mitigation
		    priorities compared to traditional methods.
