		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Forests and forestry are expected to play an
		    important role in the mitigation of climate
		    change. Forests are carbon sinks and stocks while
		    forest products can be used to replace fossil
		    based raw materials and energy. The impacts of
		    climate change on forest carbon dynamics when
		    different management strategies are applied are
		    less studied.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    In this presentation, first I'll revisit my
		    previous research topics and explain how a
		    three-dimensional canopy model can be derived from
		    sparse-density airborne LiDAR data applying
		    computational geometry and topology. Second, I'll
		    present our recent work on projecting forest
		    dynamics with an area-based matrix model.

	      Counting faces on simplicial complexes: V-E+F and beyond

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    A graph is a combinatorial object that is built
		    out of vertices and edges.  More generally, a
		    simplicial complex is a combinatorial object that
		    is built out of vertices, edges, triangles,
		    tetrahedra, and their higher-dimensional cousins.
		    The most natural combinatorial statistics to
		    collect on a simplicial complex are its face
		    numbers, which count the number of vertices,
		    edges, and higher-dimensional faces in the
		    complex.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This talk will give a survey on face numbers of
		    simplicial complexes, beginning with planar graphs
		    and moving on to graphs on other surfaces, such as
		    tori or projective planes.  From there, we will
		    study spheres and manifolds of higher dimensions.
		    We will undertake two main questions in this talk:
		    First, what is the relationship between the face
		    numbers of a simplicial complex and its underlying
		    geometric structure? Second, how can we infer
		    extra combinatorial information from properties of
		    the underlying graph of a simplicial complex, such
		    as graph connectivity or graph colorability?

	      From Reeb Graph to Mapper: An introduction to topological data analysis
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    With the rise of computers has come an era of big
		    data.  Many traditional methods of exploratory
		    data analysis fail to extract any useful insights
		    from the growing mountains of bytes.  In this
		    light, researchers have begun to look deep into
		    the world of pure mathematics for new tools that
		    could be applicable.  By making the simple
		    assumption that data has an underlying shape, the
		    world of algebraic topology becomes a ripe field
		    of theory and methods for extracting insights.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    In this talk, we will detail the Reeb graph, a
		    useful object for capturing topologically
		    important aspects of a shape.  We will then talk
		    about another object called the Mapper, which has
		    been shown to be a particularly useful
		    construction for exploring high dimensional point
		    cloud data.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    Concepts of this talk will be presented at an
		    undergraduate level and will be of interest to
		    anyone that likes pretty visualizations of big
		    data.

	      Energy propagation in deep convolutional neural networks

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    When you are asking Google to translate words from
		    one language to another, or receiving
		    recommendations for products from Amazon or movies
		    from NetFlix, or asking Siri for directions, you
		    are most likely asking for some magic using Neural
		    Networks. The field of artificial intelligence has
		    reached impressive heights with the advent of the
		    neural networks.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    In this talk, we discuss a specific type of neural
		    network called the Convolutional Neural Network
		    (CNN), and see the mathematics behind it. We will
		    talk about feature extraction, the operation that
		    allows CNNs to do what they do. Here, features are
		    considered as "energy". We analyze ways to make
		    energy propagation more efficient, thus leading to
		    energy conservation, and in turn leading to better
		    feature extraction. This talk is based on the
		    preprint with the same title available on arXiv
		    (<a target="_blank"
		    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03636">1704.03636</a>).

		    Lotka model is a continuous-time model that tracks
		    a female population's birth rate. von Foerster
		    model is a model in which the dynamics of one-sex
		    population is described by an age distribution
		    function. Two basic assumptions are made about the
		    population. These prescribe how individuals are
		    removed from and introduced into the
		    population. If the derived equations can be solved
		    for the age distribution function, then the
		    dynamics of the population can be predicted.

	      Fixed point theory and the free loop space
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Many questions in mathematics can be encoded into
		    a fixed point problem: given a self-map \(f : X
		    \to X\) of a geometric object \(X\), which points
		    satisfy \(f(x) = x\)?  For example, the Brouwer
		    fixed point theorem asserts that any self-map of a
		    disk must have a fixed point.  The Lefschetz fixed
		    point theorem gives a partial answer to the fixed
		    point problem when \(X\) is a topological space,
		    and its generalizations in geometric analysis,
		    algebraic geometry, and number theory inspired
		    many fundamental achievements of the twentieth
		    century.  After surveying these results, I will
		    describe current work that uses algebraic K-theory
		    and the free loop space to give a stronger answer
		    to the fixed point problem in the original
		    topological setting.
