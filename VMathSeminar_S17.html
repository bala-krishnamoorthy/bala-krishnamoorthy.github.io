		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Opinion dynamics models are used to reason about
		    the transmission, change, and stability of
		    opinions within a population of agents. The core
		    components of such a model are the mechanism for
		    modeling interaction and the mechanism for
		    updating the opinion held by agents after
		    interaction. Models of such systems date back to
		    the 1950s and continue to be studied today. Their
		    applicability ranges from the study of social
		    dynamics of humans to interactions in synthetic
		    systems such as distributed agent based-ones in
		    which the concept of "opinion" maps to one or more
		    state variables that are updated during agent
		    interactions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    This talk will present ongoing research work that
		    involves the creation of a generalized framework
		    for opinion dynamics models based on interactions
		    represented via potentials, with opinion updates
		    based on the minimization of all possible
		    interactions within the population. We have shown
		    that existing linear models can be represented in
		    our framework. Furthermore, we can represent
		    models that capture dynamics that cannot be
		    represented by prior models. Finally, we also
		    introduce a new concept of opinion coupling that
		    has not been well studied or modeled.

		  <p>
		    Being successful in science is about more than
		    just doing good research. It also requires that
		    individuals be able to communicate their research
		    to others. There are multiple ways to communicate
		    science, from peer-reviewed journals to popular
		    science articles to radio interviews and more. We
		    will focus our discussion on oral presentations,
		    addressing habits that make for effective speakers
		    as well as some tips for slide presentation. While
		    practice may make perfect, starting with good
		    habits will help you reach perfection that much
		    faster.

		  <p>
		    Configuration spaces of graphs have a rich network
		    of connections to many areas of mathematics, while
		    some basic properties of these spaces elude a
		    general description. This talk will introduce some
		    fundamental tools of algebraic topology that help
		    to understand better these configuration spaces,
		    and touch on a discretized model for configuration
		    spaces of graphs which has made deeper insights
		    possible. I will show how the homology of
		    configurations on trees can be completely
		    understood via configurations on subtrees, and
		    give concrete examples of the homology classes we
		    might see.

		    We consider the problem in computer vision of
		    matching features in a set of images. We are given
		    pairwise similarities (or affinities) for sets of
		    image features. Our goal is to find sets of
		    matching features which explicitly
		    satisfy <i>cycle consistency</i> across multiple
		    images. We propose an approach based on binary
		    quadratic programming.  Our main insight is that
		    using a series of carefully chosen relaxations of
		    the binary quadratic variables into binary
		    variables, the problem can be cast into a linear
		    program that could be tackled by existing
		    solvers. This is ongoing joint work

		  <p>
		    Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is the second leading
		    cause of blindness in the world, and is
		    characterized by changes in the optic nerve head
		    and retinal ganglion cell death, resulting in
		    irreversible vision loss. The lack of
		    understanding of the roles of various risk factors
		    in OAG constitutes a major limitation in the
		    diagnosis, management, and treatment of OAG. One
		    of the known risk factors for glaucoma is elevated
		    intraocular pressure (IOP).  Mathematical modeling
		    offers an important tool for understanding the
		    relative influence of risk factors by linking the
		    mechanical action of IOP on ocular tissues to the
		    blood flow and oxygen transport within the ocular
		    tissues.  The main objective of this work is to
		    study the relationship between intraocular
		    pressure, blood pressure, and blood flow
		    autoregulation in the retinal vasculature, and
		    develop mathematical models that can be used to
		    model conditions specific to individual glaucoma
		    patients.

	      Functional data analysis for dynamic CT imaging

	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Functional data are often generated when diseases
		    features are accessed repeatedly over time and at
		    multiple spatially interdependent units. The
		    problem is motivated by a liver cancer study where
		    patients underwent a dynamic computed tomography
		    (CT) protocol to enable evaluation of multiple
		    perfusion characteristics. The study was
		    undertaken with the objective of determining the
		    effectiveness of using perfusion characteristics
		    to identify and discriminate between regions of
		    liver that contain malignant tissues from normal
		    liver tissue. To reduce model complexity and
		    simplify the resulting inference, possible spatial
		    correlation among neighboring units is often
		    neglected. In this work, we consider a
		    multivariate functional data model and propose a
		    modified kernel smoothing estimation to leverage
		    the spatial and temporal correlation. We also
		    address the companion problem of developing a
		    simultaneous classification method that that
		    utilizes the inter-unit correlation information to
		    predict disease state. The proposed method
		    outperforms conventional functional data
		    classification approaches in the presence of
		    strong correlation. The method offers maximal
		    relative improvement in the presence of temporal
		    sparsity wherein measurements are obtainable at
		    only a few time points.

		  <p>
		    As convex optimization has been studied for a
		    quite long time, going beyond convexity is of
		    great interest in research of mathematical
		    optimization. A progress to go beyond convexity
		    was made by considering the class of functions
		    that can be represented as differences of convex
		    functions. In this talk, we present a number of
		    algorithms for minimizing differences of convex

		    these algorithms to solve problems of facility

		    Climate envelop models are traditionally employed
		    in predicting species ranges.  In this work we
		    develop a generalized multidimensional climate
		    envelop model of Pitch Pine ( Pinus Rigida )
		    distribution in the contiguous United States.  The
		    proposed data-intensive methodology bridges
		    information extracted by data-mining of US Forest
		    Inventories (FIA dataset) and climatic datasets
		    (19 climatic characteristics on the 1 km 2 grid).
		    This novel approach allowed us to study how every
		    single climatic variable affect Pitch Pine
		    distribution, and to evaluate whether interactions
		    between climatic factors are important for this
		    species.  In particular, we ranked 19 climatic
		    factors in order of their relative effects on the
		    species range and isolated 5 most important
		    factors.  Finally we demonstrated that the
		    interaction between factors is essential for
		    understanding of Pitch Pine distribution and
		    should not be ignored in the development of
		    climate envelop species range models.
