	      Adapting depth to Relocalization
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Relocalization is the task of estimating a
		    camera's six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose
		    within a known map, a problem with key
		    applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous
		    systems. In this talk, I will present our work
		    from the G-RIPS Sendai 2025 program in
		    collaboration with Mitsubishi Electric, where we
		    developed a novel RGB-D relocalization pipeline
		    designed to be robust to illumination changes. Our
		    approach combines global feature extraction using
		    ResNet18 + NetVLAD on both RGB and depth
		    modalities with a late-fusion strategy (Net-AF)
		    and local matching via ASIFT and SuperPoint. Depth
		    data is further projected into 3D point clouds for
		    pose estimation using RANSAC and the Kabsch
		    algorithm. We evaluated our pipeline on the
		    Stanford 2D-3D-Semantics dataset, including
		    illumination-augmented variants, and observed
		    strong performance under well-lit conditions,
		    while identifying key challenges under
		    low-light conditions. I will discuss the lessons
		    learned, the promise of multimodal fusion, and
		    future directions such as dynamic fusion weighting
		    and depth-aware feature learning.

	      A Stable Measure of Chaos for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Persistent Homology
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    One widely used measure of chaos in nonlinear
		    dynamical systems is the Lyapunov exponent, which
		    measures the rate of exponential divergence of
		    neighboring trajectories in a system's phase
		    space. This measure relies solely on Euclidean
		    distance, which we experimentally show decrease
		    its stability on known chaotic systems when
		    subject to small amounts of added Gaussian
		    noise. Many real-world systems are arguably likely
		    to contain some inherent noise. To address this
		    limitation, we introduce a novel measure of chaos
		    in nonlinear dynamical systems using persistent
		    homology, the Persistence exponent, and prove its
		    theoretical stability. We also show its greater
		    experimental stability in comparison with the
		    Lyapunov exponent on a variety of differential
		    systems with known dynamics; modeling fluid
		    motion, taffy pulling, and autocatalytic chemical
		    reactions. We finally show greater experimental
		    stability of the Persistence exponent on time
		    series data obtained from a real
		    Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction.

	      From Winding Numbers to Degrees: Cable Systems for Immersed Spheres
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    In the planar case, Blank
		    introduced words associated to immersed curves,
		    providing a combinatorial tool to encode winding
		    numbers and to derive minimal area
		    null-homotopies. Chambers and Wang later proved
		    that the minimal swept area of a null homotopy is
		    bounded below by the total winding number area,
		    with equality in the consistent winding case.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    This talk extends the picture to immersed spheres
		    in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). We introduce a cable system
		    construction, the 3D analogue of Blank's words,
		    which assigns to each region of the complement an
		    integer index via oriented cable crossings. We
		    prove that these cable indices agree with the
		    Brouwer degree of the region. Using this, a lower
		    bound for the swept 3-volume of any null homotopy
		    is obtained, expressed as a weighted sum of region
		    volumes with multiplicities. We also discuss
		    progress toward the equality case, algorithmic
		    constructions of sense-preserving null homotopies,
		    and possible reductions to 1D via curves
		    representing the cable system.

	      An Exploration of Cycle Comparison in Topological Data Analysis
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    This talk concerns the problem of reliably
		    comparing cycle representatives from persistence
		    modules drawn from separate data clouds given
		    there exists a notion of cross-dissimilarity
		    between the two sets. To do this, the talk
		    features a primer on topological data analysis and
		    the notion of distance between data clouds. It
		    then will cover the tools required for a
		    preliminary attempt at cycle comparison at the
		    chain level using the Grassmannian distance. This
		    method will then be outlined, and a minor result
		    concerning its stability will be
		    presented. Results from computer implementation
		    will be presented along, and the talk will finish
		    with potential refinements to the method that are
		    being sought.
