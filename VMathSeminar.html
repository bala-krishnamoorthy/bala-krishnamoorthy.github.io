		    In this talk, I will give an introduction to

		    homology and some more examples. Then I will talk

	      Measuring Properties of Time-Series and Police Data: A Topological and Predictive Approach
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (TBA)</h4>
		  <p>
		    In this talk, we will explore the journey behind
		    my graduate research at Washington State
		    University. We will begin with a discussion of my
		    work with the Washington State Data Exchange for
		    Public Safety
		    (<a href="https://wadeps.org/">WADEPS</a>), in
		    which I provide accessible video tutorials on
		    meaningful analysis of police use of
		    force. Motivated by my work with WADEPS, we will
		    discuss my research with the WSU Criminology
		    department using machine learning and topology to
		    predict perceptions of police use of force and
		    identify factors that impact use of force
		    outcomes. Along with the analysis of police use of
		    force and perceptions data, we will briefly
		    discuss the extension of this research in which I
		    use topology to provide a stable measure of
		    time-series similarity for police calls
		    data. Following my work constructing stable
		    topological time-series measures, I will lastly
		    discuss my latest research which uses topology to
		    construct a stable measure of exponential
		    divergence in dynamical systems. We will end with
		    a discussion of open research questions I plan to
		    investigate in the future.

	      Learning Optimal Cuts to Solve NP-hard Problems
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (TBA)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Mixed integer programs (MIPs) are optimization
		    problems involving both continuous and integer
		    decision variables and are typically NP-hard to
		    solve. Recent applications of machine learning to
		    MIPs have shown success primarily through learning
		    heuristics for variable branching or cut selection
		    within branch-and-bound frameworks. While
		    effective in practice, such approaches remain
		    heuristic in nature and are still subject to
		    worst-case exponential behavior.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    In this work, we introduce an optimal cut
		    framework for mixed integer optimization, in which
		    learned cuts guarantee that the solution of a MIP
		    is also a solution to its continuous relaxation
		    augmented with the cut. We characterize the
		    existence of such cuts using first-order
		    optimality conditions and establish conditions
		    under which they are learnable from data while
		    explicitly accounting for approximation
		    error. Building on this framework, we propose a
		    sequential linear programming algorithm that
		    leverages optimal cuts to improve integer
		    decisions and runs in polynomial time under stated
		    problem assumptions. Our results provide an
		    alternative to branching-based methods and offer
		    theoretical guarantees for learning-assisted mixed
		    integer optimization.

	      Mathematical Model of Coupled Cardiovascular-Ocular Hemodynamics 
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (TBA)</h4>
		  <p>
		    This presentation introduces Eye2Heart, a
		    mathematical model that couples cardiovascular and
		    ocular hemodynamics through a system of nonlinear
		    differential equations. Developed and verified
		    using clinical and experimental data, the model
		    captures key physiological interactions between
		    the heart and the eye. Simulations reveal that
		    elevated intraocular pressure restricts ocular
		    perfusion, while reduced left ventricular
		    compliance decreases cardiac output and retinal
		    blood flow. When both occur together, venous
		    circulation is further impaired, providing
		    mechanistic insights into conditions such as
		    normal-tension glaucoma. By linking the dynamics
		    of the eye and heart, Eye2Heart advances the
		    emerging field of oculomics and supports the
		    development of physiologically grounded tools for
		    precision medicine.
