	      Theoretical and Computational Excursion with the Laplacian
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    The Laplace operator (Laplacian), \(u\mapsto \Delta
		    u\), plays a prominent role in applied mathematics,
		    appearing in important mathematical models such as
		    the heat/diffusion equation, the wave equation, the
		    Schr&ouml;dinger equation, and some forms of the
		    Navier-Stokes equations.  As such, it has been
		    studied extensively.  Basic properties, such as the
		    Mean Value Theorem for harmonic functions (\(\Delta
		    u=0\)) on a ball or sphere, and the Maximum and
		    Minimum Principles for super-harmonic (\(\Delta
		    u\geq 0\)) and sub-harmonic (\(\Delta u\leq 0\))
		    functions on bounded domains, are typically
		    presented early in a first course partial
		    differential equations. In our first excursion, we
		    present a result that deserves to be more
		    well-known, namely that the Laplacian and its
		    powers appear very naturally in a series expansion
		    of the average value of a function on a ball or
		    sphere in terms of its radius.  This result makes
		    clear how the Laplacian of a function is a measure
		    of deviation between its average on a ball/sphere
		    and its value at the center, and its proof is
		    reasonably simple.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    Our second excursion (the rest of the talk)
		    presents a new numerical method for efficiently and
		    accurately approximating function values and
		    derivatives of a harmonic function with prescribed
		    boundary data in 2D. Using integral equations, the
		    notion of harmonic conjugates, and Cauchy's
		    Integral Formulas, only computations along the
		    boundary are needed.  The two key computational
		    tools are the trapezoid rule and the Fast Fourier
		    Transform.  A Fourier analysis of the trapezoid
		    rule explains why it is an excellent choice in this
		    context, and numerical experiments illustrate the
		    power of the approach.

		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Cryptography and coding theory perform very
		    different functions: cryptography makes a message
		    unreadable without the secret key while coding
		    theory makes the message readable even if errors
		    are introduced.  As our information world explodes,
		    data is becoming more and more vulnerable to
		    different attacks which cryptography alone can not
		    protect against, such as ransomware and DDOS
		    attacks.  This talk describes how the disparate
		    functionality of coding theory and cryptography can
		    be combined to combat these emerging attacks.

	      Phylogenetic Geometry
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    A phylogeny is a mathematical model of the common
		    evolutionary history of a group of species or
		    genes. While phylogenies are inferred from various
		    data types, in the era of advanced genome
		    sequencing technology the data used to infer the
		    phylogeny is primarily nucleotide or protein
		    sequence data. Phylogeny-inference problems are
		    most often expressed as optimization problems that
		    are in complexity classes such as NP, so
		    polynomial-time heuristics are developed to
		    approximate solutions to these problems.  These
		    heuristics can be evaluated using traditional
		    methods such as upper bounds on running time,
		    average case analysis, and statistical consistency.
		    In this talk, we discuss the alternative approach
		    of evaluating polynomial-time heuristics through
		    the lens of polyhedral geometry, and discuss the
		    growing body of literature connecting algebraic
		    geometry to statistics and phylogenetics.  No
		    previous knowledge of phylogenetics will be assumed
		    for this talk.

	      Linear Programming in Geometric Measure Theory
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    We present results on two problems related to shapes
		    in geometric measure theory (GMT) that employ
		    techniques from algebraic topology and linear
		    programming. Currents represent generalized surfaces
		    in GMT, and were introduced to study area minimizing
		    surfaces and other related problems. The <i>flat
		      norm</i> provides a natural distance in the space of
		    currents, and works by decomposing a
		    \(d\)-dimensional current into \(d\)- and (the
		    boundary of) \((d+1)\)-dimensional pieces. A natural
		    question about currents is the following. If the
		    input is an integral current, i.e., a current with
		    integer multiplicities, can its flat norm
		    decomposition be integral as well?  Surprisingly,
		    the answer is not known in general. On the other
		    hand, for the discretization of the flat norm on a
		    finite simplicial complex, the analogous statement
		    is true for d-chains in a (d+1)-complex. We develop
		    an analysis framework that extends the result in the
		    simplicial setting to that for \(d\)-currents in
		    \((d+1)\)-dimensional space, provided a suitable
		    triangulation result holds. We also prove this
		    result holds in 2D. In the second problem, we
		    consider a notion of average shape defined as the
		    median shape of currents using the flat norm
		    distance. In the corresponding simplicial version of
		    the problem, the median chain of a set of input
		    chains in a finite simplicial complex is computed
		    using linear programming.

		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    As events of the past decade have tragically

		    populations around the world&mdash;including the
		    Pacific Northwest where the Cascadia Subduction Zone

		    the risk of future tsunamis. I will discuss a

		    to probabilistic hazard analysis that are being used

	      Signaling Hypergraphs
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Cells that receive external signals from the
		    environment respond with a series of molecular
		    reactions that alter their behavior, e.g., causing
		    them to divide, move, or self-destruct. These
		    reactions constitute networks called "signaling
		    pathways" whose alterations can cause cancer and
		    other diseases. Efforts to manually curate signaling
		    pathways from the literature invite the opportunity
		    for computational methods of investigation. Directed
		    graphs are the most common representation of
		    signaling pathways, making them amenable to a wide
		    array of graph-theoretic algorithms. However,
		    directed graphs often inaccurately represent the
		    underlying biology of signaling reactions. In this
		    talk, I will describe an alternative mathematical
		    representation called a "signaling hypergraph" that
		    overcomes many limitations of graph-based
		    representations. I will present the NP-hard shortest
		    hyperpath problem and a mixed integer linear program
		    to solve it, illustrating its applicability to
		    describe plausible reactions when applied to
		    signaling hypergraphs compared to graph
		    alternatives.  Signaling hypergraphs exemplify how
		    careful attention to the underlying biology can
		    drive developments in a largely unexplored field of
		    computer science.

	      Eavesdropping on the ocean: Passive acoustic
	      monitoring technologies to estimate marine mammal
	      population sizes
	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    Population size, or abundance, estimates of many
		    marine mammal species are traditionally produced
		    using data collected from visual surveys.  However,
		    acoustic datasets can also be used to estimate
		    abundance, and offer a number of advantages over
		    visual survey methods.  One advantage is that there
		    are many instruments already deployed worldwide for
		    a variety of purposes, including military and
		    seismic monitoring, which can also be used for
		    marine mammal surveying.  In addition, more recently
		    developed technologies, such as underwater gliders
		    and other autonomous ocean vehicles, are creating
		    new monitoring opportunities.  In this seminar, I
		    will give an overview of how acoustic data can be
		    used to estimate marine mammal abundance, and
		    highlight some of the research challenges that arise
		    from (a) using opportunistic data from existing
		    instrument deployments and (b) using new
		    technologies.  The work presented here is part of
		    two ongoing research projects funded by the Office
		    of Naval Research and involves several datasets and
		    study species.  In particular, fin whale
		    (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>) monitoring using
		    Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty hydrophones in
		    the western Pacific Ocean and using an ocean glider
		    to monitor cetacean species in the Southern
		    Californian Bight will be discussed.

	      Gaussian processes for active object localization in

	      <div data-role="" class="">
		<div data-role="collapsible">
		  <h4>Abstract (click to read)</h4>
		  <p>
		    A major goal of computer vision is to enable
		    computers to interpret visual
		    situations&mdash;abstract concepts (e.g., "a person
		    walking a dog", "a crowd waiting for a bus", "a
		    picnic") whose image instantiations are linked more
		    by their common spatial and semantic structure than
		    by low-level visual similarity. In our previous
		    work, we developed a system combining given and
		    learned knowledge of the structure of a particular
		    situation which then adapts this knowledge to a new
		    situation instance as it actively searches for
		    objects.  In the current research, we apply Gaussian
		    process regression in conjunction with image feature
		    extraction using deep convolutional neural networks
		    to perform a novel and efficient, active object
		    localization for the purpose of visual situation
		    recognition.
